## Overview

Create your influencer marketing platform or data analysis tools using CreatorDB's public Application Programming Interface (API). Other applications include automatically generating performance reports on hundreds of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the influencer market. Our system provides data in JSON format and ensures secure communication via HTTPS encryption. Just send HTTP requests from your server to our APIs to access our comprehensive creator database. You can access the public data of key creators from social media platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Threads, and Facebook.

## Rate limits

You can make up to 50 API requests per second! CreatorDB's API server uses load balancing and auto-scaling mechanisms to delegate requests to different machines, allowing a large volume of API calls without sacrificing speed and bandwidth. Just make sure you have purchased enough API credits to make bulk requests.
